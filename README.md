# Chess
A Windows desktop chess application built with C#, .NET Framework, and WPF. The project features standard chess logic with a simple graphical interface for playing and testing gameplay mechanics. It will act as the foundation for future enhancements including multiple game modes and engine development.

# Overview
This project implements the core rules of chess inside a structured C# codebase. It includes board state management, move validation, turn handling, and piece-specific logic.

The WPF front-end provides a lightweight interface for visualizing the board and interacting with the game.
